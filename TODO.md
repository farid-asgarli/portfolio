# Personal Landing Page - TODO

> **Goal:** Create an Anyma-inspired, cinematic dark landing page. Minimal, mysterious, high-fashion aesthetic. The kind of site that makes people stop and wonder "who is this?"

> **Style:** Dark, ethereal, wide letter-spacing, dramatic typography, subtle animations. Less is more.
